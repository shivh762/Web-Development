<h1>Idea: Online version of "The Holy Geeta"</h1>
I created an example of how a couple pages of it could look like. The basic framework for every verse page should be the same as the ones I made, so it wouldnt be difficult to create new verse pages.<p><br>What would need to be changed:
<br>Verse contents (devnagri and translit.)
<br>Verse translation
<br>Nav buttons on the sidebar to go back/forward by one verse.
